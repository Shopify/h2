# Hydrogen i18n Example

Hydrogen is Shopify’s stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal setup** of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.

This example demonstrates how to implement a performant i18n strategy including static language
translations for a subfolder e.g example.com/fr-CA localization strategy.
