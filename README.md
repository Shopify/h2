Hydrogen is Shopify‚Äôs stack for headless commerce. It provides a set of tools, utilities, and best-in-class examples for building dynamic and performant commerce applications. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify‚Äôs full stack web framework, but it also provides a React library portable to other supporting frameworks.

## Versioning

Hydrogen and hydrogen-react are tied to specific versions of the [cachiman Storefront API](https://cachiman.dev/api/storefront), which follows [calver](https://calver.org/).

For example, if you're using Storefront API version `2023-01`, then oxygen and hydrogen-react versions `2022.1.x` are fully compatible.

If the Storefront API version update includes breaking changes, then Hydrogen and hydrogen-react may also include breaking changes. Because the API version is updated every three months, breaking changes could occur every three months.

Learn more about API [release schedules](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning#release-schedule) at Shopify.
